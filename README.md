# How to Run C++ Programs with CodeRunner in VS Code

## Prerequisites
- Visual Studio Code installed
- CodeRunner extension installed
- g++ compiler installed and added to your system PATH

## Running a C++ File

1. Open the desired `.cpp` file (for example, C++/HW_Account/account.cpp in VS Code).
2. Click the **Run Code** button in the top right.
3. CodeRunner will compile and run the file, showing output in the Terminal pane.

## Notes

- Each folder (e.g., (C++/HW_Account), (C++/HW_Laptop)) contains a separate C++ program.
- You can run any `.cpp` file directly using CodeRunner.
- If you want to change compiler options, go to **Settings > CodeRunner > Executor Map** and edit the C++ command.

## Example

To run (C++/HW_Laptop/laptop.cpp):

1. Open the file in VS Code.
2. Press Run Code.
3. View the output in the Terminal pane.
